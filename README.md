# Ingest and Process Facebook graph data with Azure

This is a part of the project named **Facebook Friend Recommendation System** that my team and me did when studying the subject of **Social Networking** at UIT. This project is all about how we ingested, processed and enriched graph data and next, built a web application using React and NodeJs. I was responsible for the task of batch data ingestion and processing.
